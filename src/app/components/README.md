Used for reusable modular UI components

- [Presentational Components](https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-smart-components-vs-presentation-components-whats-the-difference-when-to-use-each-and-why/#letscreateapresentationcomponent) that could be used for displaying data, without knowing where the data comes from, via `@Input()` and `@Output()`
- [Smart Components](https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-2-smart-components-vs-presentation-components-whats-the-difference-when-to-use-each-and-why/#letscreateasmartcomponent) that could be used to interact with the service layer adn retrieve data, which they pass to presentational components to render
